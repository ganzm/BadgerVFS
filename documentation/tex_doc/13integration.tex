\subsection{Integration}

For the integration of the VFS core into the VFS Browser application almost
nothing had to be changed in the core. As the core is meant to be accessed by
only one thread at a time, the user interaction from the gui had to be bundled
into the \textit{WorkerController} and could be used from there without changes.
The only improvements on the core were done for the search, which allows some
wildcards that were not yet there in the first part of the project.
