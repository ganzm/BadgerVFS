\subsection{Core Classes}\label{sec:coreClasses}
Figure \ref{fig:core_classes} gives an overview of the main interfaces and
classes that were implemented. The interfaces \textit{VFSDiskManager},
\textit{VFSEntry} and \textit{VFSPath} can be used by clients using the library
implemented here.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textit{VFSDiskManager}} The implementations of this interface provide
mainly a way to open, create and dispose new virtual disks. Additionally one can
get the root entry of the file system and get additional information about an
opened disk.
\item{\textit{VFSEntry}} Represents a directory or file on the file system. A
\textit{VFSEntry} provides all the required methods to manipulate files and
directories and importing/exporting files into the virtual file system. The
general meaning of \textit{VFSEntry} is, that such objects usually exist on the
filesystem.
\item {\textit{VFSPath}} Represents a path on the file system to a given
\textit{VFSEntry}. It has a slightly looser coupling to the file system as a
path does not imperatively need to exist.
\end{itemize}

The intention of those interfaces is to hide the real implementation of the
virtual file system from a client. With that in mind it should be simple to add
a network layer upon the real implementation without changing client code.

\subsection{Mocking}
For discussing the semantics of the virtual file system and the development of 
the interfaces explained in \ref{sec:coreClasses} it was decided to implement a mock
that works against the host file system. The mock classes implement all
the interfaces and was very helpful in getting a common understanding of how the
interface shall be used by clients. In a further step it was very useful to have
the mock classes while developing the console application which could be
developed independently from the real implementation.
\subsection{Test}
During the development a bunch of test cases came to life. The tests solely
depend on the interfaces and thus they can run against the mock classes and the
real implementation. This was a huge help in finding bugs in the slightly more
complicated real implementation.
